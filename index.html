            and Lattice device specifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Results provide engineering estimates based on standard MIPI D-PHY
            specifications; hardware validation and Lattice Radiant verification
            are recommended.
          </li>
          <li>
            Device-specific line rate ranges are based on Lattice device
            capabilities; consult the latest device documentation for production
            requirements.

        <h1>Lattice Video Utility Calculator</h1>
        <p>
          The Lattice Video Utility Calculator is a collection of supplementary tools designed to assist FPGA and SoC designers with MIPI-related calculations. It simplifies key tasks such as:
        </p>  
        <ul>
          <li>Video timing and bandwidth calculations</li>
          <li>MIPI clock frequency calculations</li>
          <li>MIPI timing parameter configuration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These tools are optimized for Lattice FPGA devices, helping designers streamline workflows and ensure correct IP configuration.
        </p>

        <p></p>
         <p> 
          <strong>Target Audience:</strong> </p>
          <p>All users working with Lattice’s MIPI D-PHY Foundational IP, including MIPI CSI-2/DSI D-PHY TX and RX IP, Pixel-to-Byte Converter and Byte-to-Pixel Converter IP, as well as Lattice’s Image Signal Processing IP Core.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>How to Use:</strong></p>
          <p>The Lattice Video Utility Calculator contains three main sections: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>MIPI Configuration</li>
          <li>D-PHY Timing Parameters </li>
          <li>Video Timing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each section serves a distinct purpose and can be used independently for specific use cases. For detailed information, refer to the “What it Covers” section below and the guidelines provided within each calculator section.
          </p>
        
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>What it Covers:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>MIPI Configuration (User Configuration):</strong> Provides calculations for Bits per Clock, D-PHY Clock, Pixel Clock, and Byte Clock. These values are derived based on the MIPI IP configuration, selected device—CrossLink-NX, Avant, CertusPro-NX/MachXO5, and Certus-NX—with variations depending on package type and speed grade. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MIPI Configuration (Pixel-Byte Frequency Calculator):</strong> Compute the pixel and byte domain bandwidth for the Pixel-to-Byte Converter or Byte-to-Pixel Converter IP to ensure proper implementation. The calculation uses key parameters such as pixel clock and byte clock frequencies, output pixel lanes, MIPI lanes, bits per pixel (BPP), and D-PHY Gear. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>D-PHY Timing Parameters:</strong> Calculates D-PHY TX/RX timing parameters (e.g., t_LPX, t_HS-PREPARE, t_CLK-ZERO, etc.) minimum and maximum ranges, along with IP GUI default values. The calculations are dependent on the input line rate parameter. Currently, only Soft D-PHY with a fixed Gear 8 configuration is supported. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Video Timing: </strong> Calculate key video parameters including total bandwidth, HTOTAL, VTOTAL, pixels per frame per second, and the recommended pixel clock frequency. These calculations are based on inputs such as total active pixels, horizontal/vertical blanking, frame rate, color format, and pixels per clock. Users can choose from predefined resolution presets (CTA, CEA, VESA) or create custom presets for flexibility. 
            calculation
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Assumptions & Limitations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Hard D-PHY (maximum link rate of 2500 Mbps) with Gear 8 and Gear 16 configurations is not supported in the MIPI Configuration and D-PHY Timing Parameter calculations.
          </li>
          <li>
            MIPI D-PHY Timing Parameter calculations are compliant up to CSI-2/DSI D-PHY TX IP v2.3.1 and CSI-2/DSI D-PHY RX IP v2.0.0.
          </li>
          <li>
            Total bandwidth calculation in the Video Timing section excludes overheads such as Packet Header and Packet Footer.
